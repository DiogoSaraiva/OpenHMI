# What to prepare:

Here is the to-do list to get ready before the OpenHMI workshop:

1) 3D-printing components: This is a list [(link)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7z_LR9PL6xjs64DBJckwSwQi114tPqmKAhL10Ktr_M/edit?usp=sharing) of all 3D-printed components needed for building the robot. You can find the name of the components, number of copies needed, and recommended 3D-printing material in this list. In addition, all of the 3D-printing STL files are located in OpenHMI/Hardware/3D Printing Files. If a 3d-printer is not available to you, we recommend out-source the printing to external service like [Xometry](https://www.xometry.com). The cost is only slightly higher and the quality and shipping time is more than satisfactory.


2) Purchasing needed materials: This is a purchase list [(link)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160ENST97K0b6GmP2vGoKJ554m8fZKPFYfByFBAFuFu0/edit?usp=sharing) of all the required materials needed for building the robot. The list includes the item, a purchase link and quantity needed for building 1 OpenHMI robot.

3) Robot Skin: Amy will update this section.

4) Others: To run the robot code, either Ubuntu or Windows machines work well. However, because Opensense is based on Microsoft Platform for Situated Intelligence, a Windows machine will be needed to run the full robot + human perception demo.
