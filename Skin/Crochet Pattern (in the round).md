## Eyes and Nose

Nose: attach in center between rows 3 and 4 of the head

Eyes: attach between rows 6 and 7 of the head approx. 8 sts away from the nose on both sides

For best results, put your blank skin on the robot frame and mark the desired placement of the eyes and nose before attaching.

## Dressing the Robot Frame

Remove the head from the robot's frame, noting which direction the robot is facing (nose should align with motor 1). Place the cover over the the tower, then replace the head frame and pull the top of the cover over the head frame. With a yarn needle, use the tail attached to the head flap to sew up the back of the head and secure the flap.
