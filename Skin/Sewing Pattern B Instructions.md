## Useful Terminology:
**Right/Wrong side:** The *right side* of your fabric is the side that will be visible when the skin is on the robot. Conversely, the *wrong side* is the side that will be on the inside of the skin. (Disregard if both sides of the fabric are the same.)

**Pattern:** The *pattern* or *sewing pattern* is the set of paper cutouts you will use to cut out the fabric pieces that will make up your robot skin.

# Instructions for Sewing Pattern B

Print and cut out Sewing Pattern pieces in [Sewing Pattern B](/Sewing%20Pattern%20B.pdf). Printing on thinner paper will allow you to more easily manipulate and push pins through the pattern, but any regular printer paper will work. Print all pages of the PDF at 100% scale to ensure that the skin is the correct size. Cut out the pattern pieces.

Use the pattern to cut four head and four skirt pieces from the fabric. Pin the paper cutouts to the fabric to get a more accurate cut. If the fabric you are using is stretchy, the pattern should be arranged so that the fabric stretches in the horizontal direction (this will allow the skin to be stretched horizontally around the robot). 

Neck seams: align one head and one skirt piece wrong-side-out and pin. Sew the pieces together along their shortest side to form a seam at the neck of the skin. Repeat for the remaining three head and skirt pieces to form four panels. 

Front seams: align two panels wrong-side-out and pin together. Sew the pieces together along one side. These will be the front panels of the skin and the two remaining panels will be the back panels.

Side seams: align one front panel with another remaining panel, wrong-side-out, and pin. Sew only along the free edge of the front panel, making sure to stop about halfway up the side of the head, to form one side seam of the skin. Repeat with the other front panel and remaining panel to form one skin with 3 seams.

At this point, you have created a functional skin that will fit the robot. For a neater look, fold over the remaining raw edges of the skin about Â½ an inch and sew to create a basic hem. Sew on snaps or super glue velcro at the top, middle, and bottom of the back panels to fasten the skin.
