## Dressing the Blossom Frame

**Note:** The following steps show a quick and easy way to secure the skin on the robot by lacing the tail string on the head flap to lace up the back of the skin. For a neater, more permanent closure, consider attaching buttons or a zipper.

Starting with the headflap between the ears, drape the skin over the front of the robot frame

<p align = "center">
<img src = "/Skin/images/dress_robot_1.png" width="300">
</p>

Use a crochet hook to loosely lace up the back of the skin with the extra yarn attached to the head flap.

<p align = "center">
<img src = "/Skin/images/dress_robot_2.png" height="500">
  <img src = "/Skin/images/dress_robot_3.png" height="500">
</p>

Pull the string tight to fasten the skin then tuck it underneath the bottom edge.

Now your Blossom robot is dressed and ready to go!
