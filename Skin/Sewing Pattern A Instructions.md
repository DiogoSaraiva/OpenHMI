## Useful Terminology:
**Right/Wrong side:** The *right side* of your fabric is the side that will be visible when the skin is on the robot. Conversely, the *wrong side* is the side that will be on the inside of the skin. (Disregard if both sides of the fabric are the same.)

**Pattern:** The *pattern* or *sewing pattern* is the set of paper cutouts you will use to cut out the fabric pieces that will make up your robot skin.

# Instructions for Sewing Pattern A

Print and cut out sewing pattern pieces in [Sewing Pattern A](/Sewing%20Pattern%20A.pdf). For a regular printer, the top and bottom pieces of both the front and back panel cutouts will need to be printed separately and taped together. Printing on thinner paper will allow you to more easily manipulate and push pins through the pattern, but any regular printer paper will work. Print all pages of the PDF at 100% scale to ensure that the skin is the correct size. Cut out the pattern pieces and tape them together.

Fold the fabric wrong-side-out and use the pattern to cut out two sets of front and back panels. Pin the paper cutouts to the folded fabric to get a more accurate cut. If the fabric you are using is stretchy, the pattern should be arranged so that the fabric stretches in the horizontal direction (this will allow the skin to be stretched horizontally around the robot).

Front seam: align the two front panels wrong-side-out and pin together. Sew the pieces together along the longest side of the pieces to form the front face seam of the skin.

Side seams: align the free edge of one front panel with the curved edge of the corresponding back panel, wrong-side-out, and pin. Sew along the curved edge to form one side seam of the skin. Repeat on the other side to form one skin with 3 seams.

At this point, you have created a functional skin that will fit the robot. For a neater look, fold over the remaining raw edges of the skin about Â½ an inch and sew to create a basic hem. Sew on buttons, apply safety eyes, or embroider the eyes and nose, as shown. Sew on snaps or super glue velcro at the top, middle, and bottom of the back panels to fasten the skin.
